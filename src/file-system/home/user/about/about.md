# Hi there

Hey, I'm Vishnu Raj. I'm a curious builder, product thinker, and digital creator. I enjoy simplifying messy problems into useful products. From debt management platforms to resume tools to automation hacks â€” I love exploring how tech can genuinely help people.

I work full-time in healthcare tech, and outside of that, I spend evenings and weekends building small, useful tools.

Type "cd ~/projects" then "ls" to see details of some of the projects I have developed.
